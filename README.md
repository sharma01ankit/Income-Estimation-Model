# Income Estimation Model

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Income Estimation Model, designed to predict income levels for savings account customers with missing income information. The project leverages hybrid ensemble techniques, incorporating Enhanced KNN and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and uses geolocation-based affluence clustering.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Hybrid ensemble modeling.
- Evaluation and accuracy breakdown for different customer segments.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development.
- `src/`: Python scripts for core functionality.
- `results/`: Model performance metrics and visualizations.
- `scripts/`: Pipeline script for end-to-end execution.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
